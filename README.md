## Application Information

>Eat-Me is an online application intended to allow users to store cooking recipes. The user can create an account and begin posting. When the user creates an account the passwords are hashed and salted before they are stored in the database. This adds an extra level of security. To further secure the system, users can not bypass the login screen by typing in the address to the landing page if they are not logged in. If a user attempts to do so and is not logged in he or she is redirected to the login page.

## Application Run-Through

>Once logged in, a user can click on the Add Recipe button and enter the name of the food item, its recipe/description, and a url to link an image. Once the user enters this information and clicks the adds button, he or she is taken to the homepage and and their post along with any post previously made is displayed (with he most recent posts on top).
